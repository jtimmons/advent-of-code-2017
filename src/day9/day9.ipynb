    "A large stream blocks your path. According to the locals, it's not safe to cross the stream at the moment because it's full of garbage. You look down at the stream; rather than water, you discover that it's a stream of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You sit for a while and record part of the stream (your puzzle input). The characters represent groups - sequences that begin with { and end with }. Within a group, there are zero or more other things, separated by commas: either another group or garbage. Since groups can contain other groups, a } only closes the most-recently-opened unclosed group - that is, they are nestable. Your puzzle input represents a single, large group which itself contains many smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, instead of a group, you will find garbage. Garbage begins with < and ends with >. Between those angle brackets, almost any character can appear, including { and }. Within garbage, < has no special meaning.\n",

    "In a futile attempt to clean up the garbage, some program has canceled some of the characters within it using !: inside garbage, any character that comes after ! should be ignored, including <, >, and even another !.\n",

    "You don't see any characters that deviate from these rules. Outside garbage, you only find well-formed groups, and garbage always terminates according to the rules above.\n",

    "\n",
    "    <>, empty garbage.\n",
    "    <random characters>, garbage containing random characters.\n",
    "    <<<<>, because the extra < are ignored.\n",

    "    <!!>, because the second ! is canceled, allowing the > to terminate the garbage.\n",

    "    {{<!>},{<!>},{<!>},{<a>}}, 2 groups (since all but the last > are canceled).\n",
    "\n",
